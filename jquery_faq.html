A fire can be also lit in fireplaces at wilderness and other huts. Always use extreme caution when handling fire. The one who lights a fire is always responsible for its safe use. Please note, that making fire at these campfire sites can be banned locally.

		Gathering at the campfire sites increases the risk of coronavirus infection. Guidelines concerning coronavirus COVID-19. </dd>
